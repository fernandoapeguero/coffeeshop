# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Introduction 

The coffee shop web app is a web app for coffee recipe for the cofee lovers. recipes are added periodicaly and there are a lot of really nice flavors.

### Project Structure 

1. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)
2. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)

>_tip_: currently the frontend is connected a the backend deploy to heroku is you want to use the local backend go the environmet.ts file in the environment folder and change  the apiServerUrl to http://127.0.0.1:5000  

the build for the backend is on a different repo since the structure is a bit different to be able to deploy to heroku

# Coffee Shop Frontend

## Getting Setup

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with [Flask-based Backend](../backend). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman, and then the frontend should integrate smoothly.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Installing Node and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing Ionic Cli

The Ionic Command Line Interface is required to serve and build the frontend. Instructions for installing the CLI  is in the [Ionic Framework Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).

#### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

>_tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database. Since we want you to focus on auth, we handle the heavy lift for you in `./src/database/models.py`. We recommend skimming this code first so you know how to interface with the Drink model.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

## Running the server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

Each time you open a new terminal session, run:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=api.py;
```

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.
